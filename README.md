# React with Redux

This repo consists of a few exercises and simple projects created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg">The Net Ninja</a> in his React & Redux Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG).<br>
I went through the tutorial to consolidate my knowledge in React area and to get to know Redux.<br>
Both the teacher and tutorial itself are great and I recommend it!
